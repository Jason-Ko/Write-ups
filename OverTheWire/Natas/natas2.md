If we pop open the developer tools, the source code isn't commented anymore, however there is a blank 1x1 pixel image.

The image path is `files/pixel.png` indicating that there is a directory `files` on the server.

Navigate to the `files` directory by typing `/files` after the URL and get access to the directory with `users.txt`.

Open the `users.txt` file and get access to a list of users including natas3.
